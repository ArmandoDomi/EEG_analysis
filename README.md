# EEG_analysis
There are two periods PreTMS with range [-1000,-200] and PostTMS [200,1000]. Using measures like  autocorrelation, partial correlation and cgci we can compare the two periods with ttest

## Tasks
- Find extremes at range [0,150]  TEP
- EEG analysis
  - Single channel analysis using autocorrelation with lag=10
  - Multi channel analysis using partial correlation and cgci
